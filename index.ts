He agrees, partly to please the doc and partly because, 'I've always wondered what it was like to have a pet that likes to play with you.'Odie is one of those impossibly friendly dogs who likes everyone. No matter how mean Garfield is to him, the pooch is always back, tail wagging. But one of Garfield's tricks inadvertently goes too far and Odie is dognapped by an unscrupulous animal trainer (Stephen Tobolowsky).

In the high consequence realm, providing 'suitable assurance' that a system failure will be 'acceptably low' can be extremely difficult. Unless great care is taken, providing 'suitable assurance' approaches and often exceeds what is possible given current state of the art techniques (e.g., formal methods or first principle system design), and the term 'acceptably low' translates to reliability values that exceed the grasp of reliability techniques.A promising approach to overcoming these problems is to integrate specific system engineering practices with suitable (complimentary) techniques for providing the necessary assurance that the specific high consequence system under consideration satisfies its requirements.

Coupled with modern electronics, the new sensors would not only be able to detect nearby biological agents, but also sound alarms and even call for help.The new technology, which has been reported in a series of articles in scientific journals and at scientific meetings, is centered on a newfound ability to make highly stable, DNA-modified diamond films. The ability to build a stable platform that can 'constantly sniff' for anything unusual - and that can be integrated with microelectronic devices - has long been a problem of surface chemistry.Hamers worked in collaboration with Lloyd Smith, also a UW-Madison professor of chemistry, to develop the chemistry for the new diamond surfaces, and with Dan van der Weide, a UW-Madison professor of electrical and computer engineering, to achieve the electronic sensing.'Although there have been many advances in 'bio-chip' technologies, getting a stable platform that can be used for continuous monitoring - not just one-shot analysis - has been a long-standing problem,' Hamers says. 'And diamond solves it.'Biological sensors of the future will need to operate at the interface of biology and modern microelectronics. Not only must those sensors possess the ability to detect biological molecules of interest, they will also need to take advantage of the signal amplification and processing properties of microelectronics. Because diamond films can be deposited on silicon, the stuff of which computer chips and other microelectronic devices are made, it provides a bridge between the world of miniature electronics and biology, which requires a chemically stable platform for biosensing.Such sensors, according to Hamers, would be about the size of a postage stamp and could be sprinkled in public places such as airports, bus depots, subways, stadiums and other places where large numbers of people gather.",

The question of how, when, and to what degree human-caused shifts in climate might affect natural and man-made systems is contentious.

    text: "Assistant professor of physics Michael Pravica authored this essay, based upon a University of Nevada-Las Vegas University Forum talk and most recently presented to the Las Vegas City Council to support their passage of a resolution on global warming.Our atmosphere is comparable to a rubber glove stretched over a bowling ball -- it is very thin. Due to our atmosphere, we don't suffer the extremes of temperature of Mercury and our moon. In the opposite extreme, since our atmosphere isn't as thick or dense as Venus, we don't suffer from oppressive heat (850 Kelvin) due to greenhouse warming that prevents water from condensing there. Earth developed a very fortunate (for life) state of quasi-equilibrium. This allowed water to condense, removed most of the carbon dioxide from the air. And with liquid water as solvent, life evolved. However, human activity is probably altering this equilibrium by producing greenhouse gases (most notably carbon dioxide). These gases trap heat, warming Earth's surface and further release carbon dioxide (trapped in melting glaciers or warming oceans), further warming Earth's surface and creating a new equilibrium state in which all life may not survive. Unlike water, which readily condenses into liquid and solid (ice/snow), carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere roughly 100 years before its natural removal. Thus, any effort initiated today to reverse the warming trend will not bear fruit until decades later. Though carbon dioxide levels have cyclically varied from about 180 parts per million to 280 ppm over the last 650,000 years, we have never measured higher carbon dioxide concentrations during this period than now (370 ppm) -- roughly 27 percent higher than at any point in the Earth's 'recent' history. Though many argue that greenhouse gas release via human activity pales by comparison with volcanoes and other geothermal releases, these events are very short term and have created problems for life in the past but were 'rapidly' corrected.Carbon dioxide produced by all life (not including humans) may be larger than that created by human activity.",

    text: "The treatment was pioneered in the 1970s by Ole Ivar Lovaas, a clinical psychologist at the University of California at Los Angeles. It involves teaching skills by breaking them down to their tiniest component, then using constant reinforcement and repetition to make sure they stick - much like training a dog. At the same time, antisocial behaviour such as hand-flapping or rocking back and forth is discouraged. Initially, Lovaas did this by using smacking or shouting, though therapists now prefer to reward 'good' behaviour by praise.A study of Lovaas's work published in 1987 yielded spectacular - and to some, unbelievable - results. He found that almost half of autistic children who had received 30 to 40 hours of intensive therapy were effectively cured.Children enrolled in an ABA program do continuous drills of every conceivable life skill they need to know, whether it's putting their hand up to ask a question, brushing their teeth or sitting cross-legged on the floor.For the outside observer, it's difficult to comprehend how different the world is for children diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorders, which can range in severity from intellectual disability to the comparatively mild Asperger's syndrome.The world is a frightening and confusing place to the autistic child. They can't make sense of the signals that normal kids learn to filter and interpret, such as body language, facial expressions and noises.One of the most fascinating aspects of autism are the phobias and quirks that children develop. Wong has seen children extremely afraid of hand dryers or the sound of a flushing toilet. They may bite themselves to communicate that they are hungry, or become obsessed with certain colours, like the little boy who only wore red clothes, played with red toys and hoarded red building blocks.",

The Register takes this step to insure copyright holders access to the records of the organization charged with the fiduciary responsibility of making an equitable distribution among those entitled to receive a portion of the funds, while at the same time preserving the confidentiality of the organization's business records. These terms mirror those formulated by the parties and adopted by the Panel which allow the collective to audit the business records of the Services to insure proper payment of the royalties.Panel gave any consideration to the manner in which the collecting entity would deduct from payments to copyright owners its costs of administering the funds it receives and disburses. Nevertheless, the Panel should have addressed this key term of the compulsory license.Therefore, the Register finds it necessary to establish an additional term that permits the collecting entity to deduct from the royalties it pays to copyright owners the costs it incurs in administering the funds, so long as the costs deducted are reasonable and are no more than the actual costs incurred by the collecting entity.In considering the evidence in the record, the contentions of the parties, and the statutory objectives, the Register of Copyrights recommends that the Librarian adopt a statutory rate for the digital performance of sound recordings, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 114, of 6.5% of gross revenues from subscribers residing within the United States.In addition, the Register recommends that the Librarian adopt the reasonable terms propounded by the Panel except for those terms concerning the payment schedule for arrears and potential limitations on the scope of copyright infringement. The Register also recommends setting June 1, 1998, as the effective date for implementing the new rate and terms in order to ease the burden on each Service on meeting its initial obligations under the statutory license.Panel in the matter to set reasonable terms and rates for the digital performance right in sound recordings, 17 U.S.C. 114, the Librarian of Congress fully endorses and adopts her recommendation to set the rate for the statutory license at 6.5% of gross revenues from U.S. residential subscribers.",
